# Azure ML — Overview

Hands-on work building **end-to-end ML** on Microsoft Azure:
- Provisioned workspace, compute, and versioned **Data assets**.
- Built **Designer** pipelines and **SDK v2** jobs for regression (automobile price), classification (diabetes), and clustering (penguins).
- Logged metrics and artifacts for every run; **registered** best models with versions.
- Deployed selected models to **managed online endpoints** and validated inference with sample payloads.
- Ran **AutoML** to benchmark/tune against manual pipelines.
- Captured **reproducibility** (pinned environments, resubmittable jobs) and basic monitoring.
- Drafted a light **Data Factory → Azure ML** orchestration blueprint for scheduled training and promotion.
