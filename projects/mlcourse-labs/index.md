# ðŸ“˜ ML Fundamentals â€“ Labs & Exercises  

This section is based on **[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/)**, an open Machine Learning course by [Yury Kashnitsky (yorko)](https://github.com/Yorko), created within the [OpenDataScience (ods.ai)](https://ods.ai) community.  
Some datasets are sourced from **Kaggle** and other open resources.  

ðŸ‘‰ This is a **self-study project**, where I reproduced and experimented parts of the course to strengthen my understanding of the fast-moving field of machine learning.
