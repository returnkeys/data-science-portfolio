# 💳 Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of a **Google Cloud Skills Boost lab**.  
The goal: detect fraudulent transactions in financial data using **machine learning models** deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

## ⚙️ Workflow
- **Data Ingestion** → Processed large-scale transaction records using **BigQuery**.  
- **Feature Engineering** → Created statistical and time-based features for anomaly detection.  
- **Model Training** → Built and trained ML models using **BigQuery ML & TensorFlow**.  
- **Evaluation** → Measured model performance with metrics such as AUC and precision-recall.  
- **Deployment** → Exposed trained model through **Vertex AI** for predictions.  

## 📊 Tech Stack
- Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Vertex AI, Cloud Storage)  
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, BigQuery ML  
- Data Science: Python, SQL  

## 📝 Skills Gained
- Fraud/anomaly detection in financial datasets  
- Cloud-native ML pipelines  
- Model deployment and serving on GCP
